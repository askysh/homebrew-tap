# Homebrew cask for BenchBar.app. scripts/homebrew-render.sh fills in the
# version and the DMG's sha256; .github/workflows/homebrew-tap.yml puts the
# result in Casks/benchbar-app.rb of github.com/askysh/homebrew-tap once a
# signed release is published (docs/releasing.md).
#
# The app drives the CLI, so the cask depends on the benchbar formula. Brew
# installs the formula first when both names are given:
#   brew install askysh/tap/benchbar askysh/tap/benchbar-app
